# Exploration of the Knights Radiant Quiz

As requested here is all the code and files I used to build this exploration app
I'll mark out some specific files as I kinda just ripped most of it directly from the
website.

- `KRO.js` is the original un-edited Script for the Knights Radiant Quiz
- `Radiant.js` is where I copied over the relevant data with a couple of modifications
(
  Brandon's Team if you read this your URL for the Dustbringers is incorrect the correct URL is:
  https://bsanderson.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12213411/03_dustbringer_placard.jpg
  It's still broken on the offical quiz
)
- `TrueRadiant.html` is the webpage I quickly scrapped together to visualize the proper values. You should
just be able to open this file in the web browser and have everything just work. Since I used VueJS, and 
Bootstrap via CDN.
If you just open it with a web browser some of the images may fail to load. In that case you can
open the folder in VSCode an use the `Live Server` extension to serve the website locally, this is
what I did during development.

- `HOW.md` and `HOW.pdf` are my breakdowns of how the quiz works, It's not perfect but it give a pretty 
good rundown.
